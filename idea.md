# User Management System

- Users must be tracked along with information about the user
- Users will have permissions
- Roles will generalize these permissions 
- A user can have exceptions to their permission level ie. the role admin but not on one thing in particular
- Provide a method to call and check if the user has permissions to a resource
- Should manage read / write permissions
